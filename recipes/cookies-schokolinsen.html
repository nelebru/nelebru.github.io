      <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 180°C. Line two baking trays with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Cream together the butter, sugar, and egg for about 30 seconds until fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add flour, baking powder, and salt; mix for another 30 seconds, then transfer to a bowl.</li>
    <li>Fold in the chocolate lentils.</li>
    <li>Use two teaspoons to form walnut-sized portions of dough and place them on the trays with some space between each.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10–15 minutes, then let them cool on the tray.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>For extra chewy cookies, be them just slightly under (recommended)</li>
    <li>Press some of the chocolate candies on top of the dough before baking for a prettier look.</li>
  </ul>
