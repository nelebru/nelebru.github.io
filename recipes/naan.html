  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Stir yeast and sugar into the warm milk.
      Put the flour into a bowl, make a well in the center, and pour in the yeast mixture.
      Mix lightly with some flour from the edge and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add yogurt, salt, and baking powder. Knead the dough with a mixer (or by hand)
      for about 5 minutes until smooth. If needed, add 1 tablespoon more milk.
      Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions, form balls,
      and stretch or roll each into a small, slightly thicker-edged flatbread.
      Do not roll too thick.</li>
    <li>Heat a large nonstick pan until very hot. Place 1–3 naans in the pan.
      When the dough develops bubbles (after 40–60 seconds),
      flip and bake the other side until done.</li>
    <li>Repeat with remaining dough. Brush with melted butter or ghee to serve.</li>
  </ol>
