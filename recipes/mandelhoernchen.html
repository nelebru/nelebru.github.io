  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>175 g sugar</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>250 g finely ground blanched almonds</li>
    <li>100 g marzipan (raw marzipan paste)</li>
    <li>100 g almond flakes</li>
    <li>1 vial of bitter almond flavouring</li>
    <li>Dark chocolate (for dipping)</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 175°C (160°C fan). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, beat sugar and eggs until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add ground almonds, crumbled marzipan, and bitter almond flavouring. Mix until a sticky dough forms.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into portions, roll (usually not easy because the dough is really sticks)
      each into small logs, about max. 10 cm long.
      Form each log into a crescent shape and roll around in the almond flakes.</li>
    <li>Place the crescents on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12–15 minutes,
      until lightly golden. Allow to cool completely on a rack.</li>
    <li>Melt the dark chocolate in a water bath.
      Dip both ends of each almond horn into the chocolate and place on parchment to set.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><em>Tip for forming: </em>Use a piping bag to pipe the mixture directly onto the flaked almonds.
    This will make it easier to pull apart and shape without getting your hands very sticky.</p>
